# The Manhattan Project

(No, not *that* Manhattan Project.)

## Purpose

The DNAnexus Manhattan project is designed to visualize large, complex data sets in virtual reality Manhattan plots.

## Technology

We use a react-vr based approach, which uses WebVR under the core. You can read more about [WebVR](https://webvr.rocks/), and [react-vr](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/docs/react-vroverview.html).
